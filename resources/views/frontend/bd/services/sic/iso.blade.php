                        <p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in collaboration with the International
                            Electrotechnical Commission(IEC), has developed ISO-27001, the leading international standard
                            focused on information security . Both are eminent  organizations that develop international standards.

                    <div class="blog-details__content">
                        <p>An ISMS is a set of policies and procedures established to manage sensitive data within
                            a company. The organization is vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches in the absence
                            of an ISMS. This system is therefore an essential component of an organization.
